# Weather Dashboard Project Status

Date: May 16, 2025

## Current Status

Currently fixing issues with the favorites functionality in the Weather Dashboard application. We identified that favorites were being stored incorrectly, showing as "[object Object]" in the UI instead of properly formatted city names.

## Completed Changes

1. Fixed FavoriteCities component to properly handle favorites stored as objects
2. Updated Home component to normalize favorites when loaded from localStorage
3. Improved the display of favorite city names in error message
4. Added normalization utility function for weather data in the API module
5. Updated getFavoriteCitiesWeather to handle both string and object favorites
6. Fixed RadarMap component's interaction with localStorage favorites

## Code Changes In Progress

- Fixing the way favorites are displayed in the UI
- Ensuring consistent data format between components
- Normalizing object and string representations of favorite cities

## Next Steps

1. Verify the application is correctly displaying favorites
2. Test adding and removing cities from favorites
3. Ensure proper handling of weather data for favorite cities
4. Check that the hourly forecast in the radar map works correctly
